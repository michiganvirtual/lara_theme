          The “new norm” of today’s classrooms will likely present an overall
          increase in academic inconsistencies prevalent in students. This isn’t
          to say those inconsistencies did not exist previously. Still, today,
          the volume and frequency of inconsistencies predict a significant
          scaled increase in academic challenges for many students in many
          classrooms. With an opportunity for such widespread weaknesses,
          students needing additional support must be identified
          immediately.&nbsp;

          Universal screening identifies students in need before additional
          instructional time passes, and the issues manifest themselves through
          poor grades and problematic behavior.&nbsp;

          defines universal screening as “screening tests are periodically
          conducted, usually two or three times during a school year, to
          identify students who may be at risk, monitor student progress, or
          predict students’ likelihood of success on meeting or exceeding
          curricular benchmarks. Universal screening tests are typically brief
          and conducted with all students at a particular grade level.”&nbsp;

          It is important to note that universal screening assessments should be
          systematically developed and implemented building-wide to ensure the
          validity and reliability of results. Below are a few steps suggested
