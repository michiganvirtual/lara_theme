            When you think about the military, what jobs come to mind? Would you
            be surprised to hear that about 85% of them do not involve direct
            combat? In fact, almost every job in the civilian world also exists
            in the military. Take a moment to watch this video and learn more

          Since the filming of the above video Cadet Abrams has become First
          Lieutenant Abrams, an Army Logistics Officer. In reflection on his
          high school and early adult life, he writes that he experienced false
          starts academically and significant personal turbulence. He has found
          personal stability, thrived academically, and advanced professionally,
          in part, because of the opportunities he’s taken advantage of while
          serving.

              I’m not sure why we moved so much, but wherever she moved, I
              followed. I played basketball for all of the high schools I
              attended except for “Lawrence Education Center.” Lawrence
              Education Center is an alternative school and did not have any

              High school was pretty fun for me. That’s when I began to learn
              who I was as a man. I did things early on to try to fit in, but it
              ended up not working out. I was a follower for a brief period of
              time before I learned that it was okay to be myself. If I could
              summarize high school for me, I’d say it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t
              like moving as much as I did, but I managed to get along with
              people everywhere I went. I just always remember feeling like I
              didn’t have a home. I didn’t go to high school in Chicago, and
              that’s where I’m from, but when my mom moved us (my older sister
              and younger brother) away, it was never quite the same. It’s also
              the reason why no matter where I moved, I was always home visiting
              family and friends.

              The Graduation Test
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-2 text-lg font-normal text-dark-gray">
              My senior year was the most interesting year for me because we
              moved to a different state, Savannah, Ga. Savannah was totally
              different from Chicago. The size of the city, the food, and the
              weather just to name a few. When we got settled and I started
              going to Jenkins high school, it was a culture shock. In addition
              to having a new complete setting, Georgia has what’s called a
              “Graduation Test.” You had to pass this in order to actually be
              eligible for graduation. I met some students that completed high
              school but couldn’t pass a portion of Georgia’s “Graduation Test”
              therefore, they never received their diploma. Georgia’s
              “Graduation Test” is similar to an SAT or ACT, in which you get
              tested in English, Math, Social Studies, Reading, and Science. In
              each category, you have to meet the qualification of scoring a
              specific score or else you fail that portion of the test and have
              to retake it at a later time. Long story short, I passed all of
              the tests except for Science and Social Studies.

              I continued to [take the tests] throughout [my senior] year
              leading up to graduation but I continued to fail. I was getting
              discouraged because I could not pass those two tests to save my
              life. In Chicago, in order to graduate, you’d have to take the
              “Constitution Test” in order to be eligible for graduation. I was
              familiar with the school system in Chicago, IL, but not in
              [Georgia].

              While continuing to retake the parts of the test that I kept
              failing, I learned that I was expecting a child by the tail end of
              my senior year and that’s when things changed for me. I didn’t
              show it but I was embarrassed. I had friends, but I stayed to
              myself a lot. I never participated in the senior events leading up
              to graduation because I wasn’t sure if I was going to pass the
              graduation test (social studies and science). I was working at a
              Gas Station and had been working there since moving to Savannah.
              My focus changed because of the pregnancy. I still wanted to go to
              college but I had to focus on passing the graduation test along
              with preparing to bring a child into the world. There was a lot on
              the line because if I didn’t pass the graduation test in time for
              graduation, I wouldn’t be able to start college on time like I had
              planned.

              did not graduate from Jenkins high school. I took one more shot at
              the graduation test after graduation and failed. I then made the
              decision to move with my uncle and aunt in Springfield, IL to
              attend Lawrence Education Center. Once enrolled, I graduated three
              months after I started classes. I was the student of the month
              because of the time it took me to receive my diploma. The timeline
              I had planned out changed all because of me not passing the

              to move forward and plan what was next.

              wanted to do early on. Since I played basketball, I knew I’d want
              a career surrounding sports. During my sophomore year, I
              researched various careers. The one that stood out to me was
              “Physical Therapy.” I was intrigued by the movement of the body.
              While I was working at the gas station during my senior year of
              high school, I had a lot of customers that would say the most
              random things to me. One customer told me, “you’re going to go on
              and do great things in life”, and another customer mentioned the
              “Air Force.” I often wondered what people saw in me that made them
              say such things.

                This picture was taken during my promotion from 2nd Lieutenant
                to 1st Lieutenant. I was promoted on March 19, 2019. My command
                team along with the rest of the leadership from my company came
                to support me. I bought food for everyone who attended. That's
                usually how it goes, whoever gets promoted, buys food for those
                who plan to attend the promotion ceremony. The promotion meant
                more responsibility. Before the promotion, I was a Platoon
                Leader in charge of 40 Soldiers. Once promoted, I assumed the
                title and position of XO (Executive Officer), in charge of an
                entire company totaling 278 Soldiers. The company I assumed
                responsibility of is 377th Transportation (HET) Company out of
                Fort Bliss, TX.

              Overcoming Obstacles

              The customer that mentioned the “Air Force” didn’t really have an
              impact on me. I thought about the military for a brief moment
              after he mentioned it, but I didn’t pay it any mind. After having
              my son, things for me didn’t go well. I worked two jobs, ‘cashier
              at a gas station’ and ‘night auditor at the Marriott Hotel.’ I was
              also attending Savannah Technical College full time, where I was
              going for my associates in Science in hopes to transfer to
              Savannah State University. Things did not go as planned, needless
              to say I was faced with some very difficult obstacles. I ended up
              moving back to Chicago to better my life and that’s when things
              changed for the better.

              When I moved back home, I enrolled at Wilbur Wright College. It
              was difficult for me to find a job and boy did I try. During that
              time I knew I wanted something more out of life. I also wanted to
              make a decision that my son would benefit from. The military came
              to mind, and I took a leap of faith and joined (March of 2010). I
              took two semesters off because of basic and AIT training. During
              the first couple of years being in the military, I began to notice
              different options and career paths that I could take advantage of.

              Position of Power
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-2 text-lg font-normal text-dark-gray">
              I knew I wanted to be in a position of power. I also knew that I
              wanted to graduate college with my bachelor’s degree. I came up
              with a plan to be able to do both. Once I graduated with two
              associates from Wilbur Wright (general studies and in science;
              2014), I transferred to Chicago State University where I enrolled
              into their ROTC Program and graduated in the fall of 2017. The
              rest is history. Not necessarily history because I have so much
              more I have to accomplish in life, but that’s where I was able to
              stay on track and not only graduate but also commission as an
              Officer in the Army.

            <p class="mb-2 text-lg font-normal text-dark-gray">
              I believe the Army was the right choice for me. I didn’t grow up
              wanting to be in the military, let alone an Officer in the Army
              but I must say, I’m satisfied. My job is challenging to say the
              least but overall, I’m happy that I can provide for my family and
              myself.
