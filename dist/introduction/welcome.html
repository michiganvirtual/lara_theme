            Welcome to the Michigan Ongoing Health and Safety Training Refresher
            2023. This training was developed to meet the federal requirement
            for ongoing health and safety training under the Child Care and
            Development Block Grant. In Michigan, all child care providers
            (licensed and license exempt) are required to complete an annual
            health and safety refresher training.&nbsp; Each year, a required
            refresher health and safety training will be offered to meet
            the&nbsp; federal requirement.&nbsp;

            Licensing Rules
          </h3>
          <p class="text-white text-lg">
            This course is designed to meet the ongoing health and safety
            training requirement for licensed and license exempt child care
            providers. It is the responsibility of all child care providers
            working in licensed programs (child care centers or homes) to be
            familiar with and adhere to all licensing rules related to the
            topics discussed in this training. For license exempt child care
            providers, these rules should be viewed as recommendations
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-white text-lg">
            For those of you that are working in licensed programs (child care
            center, family child care home or group child care home), there will
            be occasions in this training where specific licensing rules will be
            emphasized; however, there will be other licensing rules that are
            related to a specific topic that will not be included in the
            training. Time constraints and the diversity of the audience,
            prevent us from addressing the majority of rules related to these
            topics. The focus of this training is to provide a good overview and
            discuss best practices related to the health and safety topics.
