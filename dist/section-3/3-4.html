          Preparing for emergencies is very challenging in a child care
          situation. Infants, toddlers, and preschoolers do not possess the
          developmental skills required to care for themselves. They are totally
          dependent on you. Your plan must be different than that of another
          facility or a school. You can not tell the children under your care to
          just leave the building in the face of an emergency. The unique needs
          of this age group must be considered when writing and implementing
          your emergency plan. Now we will look at some of those specific needs.

                  The youngest children will not be able to verbally identify
                  themselves. Even older children in your care may not know who
                  their emergency contacts are or how to reach them. Therefore,
                  it is crucial that your emergency kit includes identification
                  cards for children and emergency contact information.

                  Children’s bodies are more physiologically vulnerable. Their
                  bodies are smaller and less developed than adults’. This puts
                  them at greater risk for illness or harm during an emergency.
                  Children have thinner skin, take more breaths per minute, and
                  are closer to the ground. This makes them more susceptible to
                  harmful chemicals and carbon monoxide poisoning. They also
                  have more daily person-to-person contact which makes them more
                  susceptible to contagious threats.
