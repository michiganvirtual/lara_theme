                  All new hires must receive general training on emergency
                  preparedness. All child care providers and volunteers also
                  receive ongoing training as part of the federal and state
                  requirements. Emergency Preparedness focuses on training
                  providers on the preparation, response and recovery of all
                  types of emergencies in child care settings. In addition to
                  this all staff must be trained on the child care facility’s
                  Emergency Plan. Those involved with caring for infants and
                  toddlers, children with special needs, and children with
                  chronic medical conditions must also receive training on the
                  unique needs of those children.

                  Next comes drills. LARA requires fire drills quarterly and
                  tornado drills twice per year. In addition to this staff
                  should go through drills for each type of emergency discussed
                  in the plan. Drills must happen during hours that children are
                  being cared for.

          Emergency situations are not conducive to calm and composed thinking.
          A written plan offers the opportunity to prepare. Drills and practice
          offer the insurance that when an emergency hits the child care
          provider can respond in a more calm and organized manner.
