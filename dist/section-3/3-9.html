          The image on this slide is the front or top half of the Child
          Information Record. The full form is available on the LARA website. It
          is important to have this form or a comparable substitute for every
          child in your care. Be sure to take it with the dayâ€™s attendance
          roster if you need to evacuate and/or relocate. This could be an
          essential tool for monitoring children and ensuring reunification with
          families. In an emergency children should only be released to parents
          and authorized individuals with a photo ID.

          It is also important to keep vital business records safe and secure.
          Records could be kept in a secure off-site location, in fire-proof
          storage, or under a password protected external drive. Access to these
          is necessary to maintain Continuity of Operations.
