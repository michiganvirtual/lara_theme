              The form must be completed and signed by the parent or guardian.
              An electronic signature from the child’s parent is acceptable. For
              all prescription and nonprescription medications the form must be
              completely filled out by the parent. Non-prescription topical

              The form must include the dose, time to be given each day, and the
              number of days to be given.&nbsp; If the medication is one that is
              ordered to only be given when needed (such as tylenol for
              headaches or an Epipen for emergencies) “As needed” may be written
              in under time of medication.&nbsp; This is a good time to note
              that if the timing works out for a medication to be given at home
              instead of at the child care program that is always
              preferred.&nbsp;
