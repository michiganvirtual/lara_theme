              The next few pages will review the developmental milestones for
              children at various stages.. Please note that these are only a few
              of the examples of skills and ages. There are much more detailed
              tools for you to use to monitor developmental milestones. Several
              of these resources are identified in the support material section
              of this section.

              Development is a highly interactive process, and life outcomes are
              not determined solely by genes

              The environment in which one develops before and soon after birth,
              provides experiences that chemically modify certain genes. So,
              while genetic factors influence the human development,
              environmental factors have the ability to alter family
              inheritance.

              While attachments to their parents are primary, young children can
              also benefit significantly from relationships with other
              responsive caregivers within and outside the family
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-white font-normal">
              Close relationships with other nurturing and reliably available
              adults do not interfere with the strength of a young child’s
              primary relationship with his or her parents. In fact, they can
              promote young children’s social and emotional development. But
              also, frequent disruptions in care, high staff turnover, and poor-
              quality interactions in child care can undermine a child’s ability
              to establish secure expectations about whether and how their needs
              will be met.

              Adverse fetal and early childhood experiences can lead to physical
              and chemical disruptions to the brain that can last a lifetime.

              along with poor physical and mental health outcomes.

              A great deal of brain architecture is shaped during the first
              three years after birth, but the window of opportunity for its
              development does not close on a child’s third birthday
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-white font-normal">
              Basic aspects of brain function, such as the ability to see or
              hear, and some emotional development, do depend on the early
              years. However, brains continue to develop well into adolescence
              and adulthood. So even though the principle “earlier is better
              than later” still applies, most domains of development remain open
              far past 3 years old. We are also capable of learning ways to
              “work around” earlier impacts well into adult years.
