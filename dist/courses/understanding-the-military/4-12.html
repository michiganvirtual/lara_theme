          Now that you know more about the modern military, let's revisit
          Lieutenant Abrams' story. In the version below we've included links to
          pop-ups with suggestions about how counseling services could have
          helped the student discover the education and career path that was
          right for him.

            I moved a lot, mostly having to do with my mother. I’m not sure why
            we moved so much, but wherever she moved, I followed. I played
            basketball for all of the high schools I attended except for
            “Lawrence Education Center.” Lawrence Education Center is an
            alternative school and did not have any sports programs.

              This photo is of me and my auntie. Many would guess that she's my
              mom. My mother is much lighter than me, so those who have never
              seen my mom think my aunt is my mother. This picture was taken
              after my 8th grade graduation. I was tall for my age, about 5'11
              going into high school. I didn't grow much afterwards. I ended up
              being 6'1/ 6'2.

            High school was pretty fun for me. That’s when I began to learn who
            I was as a man. I did things early on to try to fit in, but it ended
            up not working out. I was a follower for a brief period of time
            before I learned that it was okay to be myself. If I could summarize
            high school for me, I’d say it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t like moving
            as much as I did, but I managed to get along with people everywhere
            I went. I just always remember feeling like I didn’t have a home. I
            didn’t go to high school in Chicago, and that’s where I’m from, but
            when my mom moved us (my older sister and younger brother) away, it
            was never quite the same. It’s also the reason why no matter where I
            moved, I was always home visiting family and friends.

            My senior year was the most interesting year for me because we moved
            to a different state, Savannah, Ga. Savannah was totally different
            from Chicago. The size of the city, the food, and the weather just
            to name a few. When we got settled and I started going to Jenkins
            high school, it was a culture shock. In addition to having a new
            complete setting, Georgia has what’s called a “Graduation Test.” You
            had to pass this in order to actually be eligible for graduation. I
            met some students that completed high school but couldn’t pass a
            portion of Georgia’s “Graduation Test” therefore, they never
            received their diploma. Georgia’s “Graduation Test” is similar to an
            SAT or ACT, in which you get tested in English, Math, Social
            Studies, Reading, and Science. In each category, you have to meet
            the qualification of scoring a specific score or else you fail that
            portion of the test and have to retake it at a later time. Long
            story short, I passed all of the tests except for Science and Social
            Studies.

              This picture was taken during my Junior year of ROTC. I was at a
              military ball. By this time, I had been in the Reserves for about
              6 years. I would go to drill on the weekends with my Reserve unit
              in Darien, IL 863rd Engineer Battalion once a month. For the
              remainder of the month I would attend school full time and
              participate in ROTC classes and events.

            I continued to [take the tests] throughout [my senior] year leading
            up to graduation but I continued to fail. I was getting discouraged
            because I could not pass those two tests to save my life. In
            Chicago, in order to graduate, you’d have to take the “Constitution
            Test” in order to be eligible for graduation. I was familiar with
            the school system in Chicago, IL, but not in [Georgia].

          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            While continuing to retake the parts of the test that I kept
            failing, I learned that I was expecting a child by the tail end of
            my senior year and that’s when things changed for me. I didn’t show
            it but I was embarrassed. I had friends, but I stayed to myself a
            lot. I never participated in the senior events leading up to
            graduation because I wasn’t sure if I was going to pass the
            graduation test (social studies and science). I was working at a Gas
            Station and had been working there since moving to Savannah. My
            focus changed because of the pregnancy. I still wanted to go to
            college but I had to focus on passing the graduation test along with
            preparing to bring a child into the world. There was a lot on the
            line because if I didn’t pass the graduation test in time for
            graduation, I wouldn’t be able to start college on time like I had
            planned.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            I ended up taking the graduation test for the last time, a month
            before graduation. I passed Science, and failed Social Studies. I
            did not graduate from Jenkins high school. I took one more shot at
            the graduation test after graduation and failed. I then made the
            decision to move with my uncle and aunt in Springfield, IL to attend
            Lawrence Education Center. Once enrolled, I graduated three months
            after I started classes. I was the student of the month because of
            the time it took me to receive my diploma. The timeline I had
            planned out changed all because of me not passing the graduation
            test on time. There was nothing I could do but continue to move
            forward and plan what was next.

              This picture was taken during my promotion from 2nd Lieutenant to
              1st Lieutenant. I was promoted on March 19, 2019. My command team
              along with the rest of the leadership from my company came to
              support me. I bought food for everyone who attended. That's
              usually how it goes, whoever gets promoted, buys food for those
              who plan to attend the promotion ceremony. The promotion meant
              more responsibility. Before the promotion, I was a Platoon Leader
              in charge of 40 Soldiers. Once promoted, I assumed the title and
              position of XO (Executive Officer), in charge of an entire company
              totaling 278 Soldiers. The company I assumed responsibility of is
              377th Transportation (HET) Company out of Fort Bliss, TX.

            Looking back when I was in high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted
            to do early on. Since I played basketball, I knew I’d want a career
            surrounding sports. During my sophomore year, I researched various
            careers. The one that stood out to me was “Physical Therapy.” I was
            intrigued by the movement of the body. While I was working at the
            gas station during my senior year of high school, I had a lot of
            customers that would say the most random things to me. One customer
            told me, “you’re going to go on and do great things in life”, and
            another customer mentioned the “Air Force.” I often wondered what
            people saw in me that made them say such things.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            The customer that mentioned the “Air Force” didn’t really have an
            impact on me. I thought about the military for a brief moment after
            he mentioned it, but I didn’t pay it any mind. After having my son,
            things for me didn’t go well. I worked two jobs, ‘cashier at a gas
            station’ and ‘night auditor at the Marriott Hotel.’ I was also
            attending Savannah Technical College full time, where I was going
            for my associates in Science in hopes to transfer to Savannah State
            University. Things did not go as planned, needless to say I was
            faced with some very difficult obstacles. I ended up moving back to
            Chicago to better my life and that’s when things changed for the
            better.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            When I moved back home, I enrolled at Wilbur Wright College. It was
            difficult for me to find a job and boy did I try. During that time I
            knew I wanted something more out of life. I also wanted to make a
            decision that my son would benefit from. The military came to mind,
            and I took a leap of faith and joined (March of 2010). I took two
            semesters off because of basic and AIT training. During the first
            couple of years being in the military, I began to notice different
            options and career paths that I could take advantage of.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            I knew I wanted to be in a position of power. I also knew that I
            wanted to graduate college with my bachelor’s degree. I came up with
            a plan to be able to do both. Once I graduated with two associates
            from Wilbur Wright (general studies and in science; 2014), I
            transferred to Chicago State University where I enrolled into their
            ROTC Program and graduated in the fall of 2017. The rest is history.
            Not necessarily history because I have so much more I have to
            accomplish in life, but that’s where I was able to stay on track and
            not only graduate but also commission as an Officer in the Army.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            I believe the Army was the right choice for me. I didn’t grow up
            wanting to be in the military, let alone an Officer in the Army but
            I must say, I’m satisfied. My job is challenging to say the least
            but overall, I’m happy that I can provide for my family and myself.
