          Education Services Specialists [ESS], usually civilians, are the
          subject matter experts on education for a particular branch of
          service. They conduct partnership initiatives at the state and local
          level and maintain relationships between educators, institutions and
          community partners and the military recruiting services. They also
          manage and support education and career programs sponsored by the
          military that are available to all students, regardless of military
          intent or eligibility.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-dark-gray mb-8">
          The ESS has a professional background in education and works between
          the worlds of education and military. The ESS is able to answer a wide
          variety of questions that counselors might have about programs, such
          as the ASVAB-CEP, educational requirements for military service and
          educational and training opportunities for service members once they
          enlist. ESSs also work to stay up to date on local and state
          educational and school counseling trends and standards - areas where
          counselors are likely to have specific expertise. Not all branches
          have an Education Services Specialist.
