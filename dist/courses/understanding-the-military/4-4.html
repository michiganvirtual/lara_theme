          All Military careers are available as a full-time commitment; some of
          these careers have a part-time option. Helping your students
          understand the types of services available to the career paths theyâ€™ve
          expressed an interest in will contribute to their decision making.

              Full-time members of the Military serve on an Active Duty basis,
              with a time commitment similar to a full-time job. They are
              stationed at a base either domestically or overseas. In either of
              those situations, they may live on post, in military housing, or
              in civilian communities. Active-duty terms typically last two to
              six years, depending on the job and the amount of training
              necessary to qualify for that job. Just over one-half of all
              Service Members choose active service.

        <p class="text-dark-gray text-lg mb-8">
          Part-time service members train one weekend a month and two weeks a
          year, allowing them time to pursue a civilian career or college.
          Part-time service options fall under three types: Reserve, National
          Guard, and Split Training.

              <p class="text-dark-gray text-lg mb-8">
                The purpose of the Reserve is to maintain trained service
                members to be made available for active duty as needed in times
                of war or national emergency. Each active-duty branch of the
                Military has a Reserve component under their command and some
                active-duty service members switch to the Reserve to finish out
                their service commitment. Reservists are likely to have civilian
                jobs outside their Reserve commitments.

                The Guard focuses on homeland security and humanitarian relief.
                National Guard units assist communities in their state during
                emergencies like storms, floods, fires, and other natural
                disasters. The two Guard branches are the Army National Guard
                and the Air National Guard. Guard members can and are deployed
                outside the US in national and international engagements based
                on the needs of the nation.

                Split Training Option
              </h3>
              <p class="text-dark-gray text-lg mb-8">
                The Army, Army National Guard, and Coast Guard offer a split
                training option in which students train for two summers and
                serve one weekend a month during the school year. Students are
                paid for their weekend service and begin Reserve duty once their
                training is complete. The Army and Army National Guard allow
                17-year-olds, with parent/guardian consent, to begin training
                between their junior and senior years of high school. The Coast
                Guard requires the student to be attending a college or
                vocational school before participating in their split time
                program. Some branches allow college credit to be earned during
                split training.
