          This course offers State Continuing Education Clock Hours (SCECHs). To
          earn your SCECHs, please make sure you've completed all activities and
          have spent the equivalent of the SCECH minimum learning your way
          through the course. You can check your "Grades" to be sure that all
          the activities have been completed. Your SCECHs will be uploaded to
          MOECS within 10 days of the end of your course. At that time you will
          be notified via the email address on your MOECS account with further
          directions on how to claim your SCECH credits in the MOECS system.
