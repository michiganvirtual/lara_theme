                  Taylor can attend a dedicated culinary school and graduate as
                  a trained chef. This option may require moving for education
                  and is quite expensive: tuition alone runs about $30,000 and

                  Jay can take classes in journalism, mass communications and
                  writing to lay the foundation for being employed as a
                  journalist. If the school is well-connected, an internship
                  will be a critical part of breaking into the broadcast

                  broadcast and other journalists. There may also be significant
                  student debt involved in reaching this goal.
