              Do you have a student who is interested in joining the military?
              The best thing you can do is help them set up a meeting with a
              recruiter. A recruiter is the subject matter expert on all of the
              requirements and benefits of their branch of service. A
              conversation with a recruiter does not commit anyone to military
              service or even further engagement with that branch or the
              military in general. In the interest of exploring all available
              options, you may want to encourage students to talk with
              Recruiters from more than one branch of service. The various
              branches of service may have different entrance requirements for
              the same or similar jobs, for example.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark-gray text-lg mb-4">
              Every year schools should offer parents and students an option to
              “opt-out” of being contacted by the military, colleges and
              employers in writing. If a student is on this list, no military
              recruiter may call or solicit contact with that individual.
              However, a student may choose to speak with a recruiter, if they
              initiate the contact, even if they or their parent has put them on
              the opt-out list.
