          Both enlisted and officer careers provide rewarding experiences,
          educational and training benefits, and competitive compensation, but
          the requirements, commitments, and responsibilities are different for
          enlisted service members vs. officers.

        <p class="text-lg text-dark-gray mb-8">
          Are your students interested in a career field only available to
          enlisted personnel or only available to officers? You’ll want to
          ensure that the student is aware of the requirements and the basic
          experiences they’ll encounter with pursuing enlistment or officership.

        <p class="text-lg text-dark-gray mb-8">
          Students often choose the enlisted route of service when they are
          passionate about a specific job, career field, or branch of service.
          If the student’s chosen career path requires or has the option of
          enlistment, you’ll want to help them understand the enlistment
          process.

          Individuals interested in military enlistment should consider the

        <ol class="text-lg text-dark-gray list-decimal pl-8 mb-8">
          <li class="mb-2">
            You must be 18 years old (17 with parental consent). The maximum age
            to join most Services is 35. Note: Because the age requirements can
            vary at different times, it is best to check with a Recruiter about
            current requirements and limitations for a specific branch of
            service and job.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            There are ways to gain citizenship through military enlistment. If
            an individual wants to become an officer they will need to become a
            U.S. citizen.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            You must have a high school diploma (preferred) or a high school
            equivalent such as the GED. People who have completed at least
            fifteen semester hours of college above the 100 level may also be
            eligible for enlistment as may

          Careers in the military that require officership are typically
          leadership roles. If a student’s chosen career path requires or has
          the option of becoming a military officer, you’ll want to advise them
          on the three basic pathways to officership.

                The service academies, military colleges, and maritime academies
                combine the college experience with military culture. They all

                education in exchange for a promise of at least five years of
                service. They are also all highly competitive and the

                OCS is a condensed officer training program that ranges from 10
                to 17 weeks depending on the service branch. Traditional college

                (DCOs) can take advantage of OCS to pursue officer roles.
