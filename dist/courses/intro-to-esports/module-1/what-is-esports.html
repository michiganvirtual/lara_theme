          Esports, or competitive gaming, is the fastest-growing high school
          sport in the country and, much like traditional sports, requires
          teamwork, critical thinking, and communication to achieve success.
          However, esports goes even further to create a barrier-breaking,
          all-inclusive environment with a strong sense of community. All games
          are selected based on their competitiveness and strategy and are rated
          E for Everyone.
