              A recent survey shows that 72% of American teens play video games
              regularly. Why not capitalize on and engage students in what they
              are already doing? Esports offers the opportunity to reach
              students who are often otherwise disengaged from the school
              community. According to

              >, 45% of students involved in sports haven't participated in any
              other school sports or activity. Thousands of high schools across
              the country are reaching a new student population by offering
              esports. Players develop a sense of belonging and have
              opportunities to meet new friends, and foster school pride by
              playing on a team with fellow classmates.

              Additionally, esports is <strong>more inclusive</strong> than
              traditional sports. Athleticism, gender, race, age, and ability
              level do not factor into who can participate. All students can
              equally participate and demonstrate their leadership skills and
              game strategies. Any student who can use a computer, console, or
              mobile device can play. There’s no limit on how many teams can
              form at the varsity level, giving all players an opportunity to
              compete. Esport teams are all-inclusive and
