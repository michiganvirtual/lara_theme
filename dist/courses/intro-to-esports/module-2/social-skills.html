          Gaming is often a solitary activity and students who enjoy gaming are
          often those who are less involved in school activities. Competitive
          esports provides a way for like-minded students to meet in person on a
          regular basis, in pursuit of common goals – providing a sense of
          belonging for those who might otherwise opt out of school activities.
          As a scheduled school activity, esports clubs provide the opportunity
          to form friendships, gain respect from fellow students and increased
          self-esteem. [<a

          suggests the following pledge for esports competitors:

        <ul class="pl-8 text-lg text-dark-gray mb-8 list-disc list-outside">

          <li class="mb-2">
            Respect the sincere opinions of others, even if they’re different

          Like many high school clubs and sports, esports helps students learn
          valuable skills that will serve them well throughout their life. Among
          the skills developed through esports are strategic thinking, teamwork,
          collaboration, goal setting, preparation, and managing success and
          failure. Many students are already passionate about gaming. Esports
          provides an opportunity for students to come together and bond over a
          shared interest.

        <p class="text-lg text-dark-gray mb-4">
          Esports also encourages students who compete in these intense and
          fast-paced, real-time strategy games to quickly problem-solve and
          adapt to win. Players are required to set goals, assess the
          competition, and evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses. As a
          team member, students learn to establish tactics, create game plans,
          and pivot as needed.
