          Esports is a relatively new field offering a wide variety of careers
          that is growing exponentially each year, as indicated by the graph
          below. The video game industry has already passed the movie,
          television, and music industries as the biggest entertainment industry
          on the planet, and shows no signs of slowing.

          (link), the video game industry will rise to over $200 billion in
          2022-23. This industry is larger than music, television & film
          industries combined. The number of video game downloads/purchases,
          people playing games, and revenue generated from esports events, will
          all continue to rise over the next few years. Live-streaming esports
          will rise as well with an expected audience of 1.4 billion consumers
          by 2025. With such a large industry, video games will provide
          opportunities related to careers, education, and entertainment
          sectors. Knowing the global impact of this industry, how can schools
          leverage the popularity to provide safe, educational, career pathways
          and skills-focused opportunities for students?

          In addition to developing important skills that can help students
          succeed in just about anything they do, esports itself is a
          fast-growing industry that offers many job opportunities beyond being
          a pro player. These include careers related to production,
          programming, streaming, management of esports teams, game development,
          graphic design, marketing, video production, and even STEM fields, as
          previously mentioned in this course. When there is esports in schools,
          students can learn about a wide array of career opportunities.
