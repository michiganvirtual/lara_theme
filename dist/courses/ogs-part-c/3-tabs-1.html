            <h2 class="">Stay Calm</h2>
            <p>
              The most important thing you can do during and after an emergency
              is to stay calm. Children easily pick up on and mirror the fears
              and anxieties of the adults around them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-2">
            <h2 class="">Comfort Children</h2>
            <p>
              Make children feel safe and comfort them. Children may crave more
              attention and need to be held and cuddled more. Give it to them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-3">
            <h2 class="">Reassure Safety</h2>
            <p>
              Reassure children that steps are being taken to keep them safe.
              Point out the things that are already in place to keep them safe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-4">
            <h2 class="">Encourage Questions</h2>
            <p>
              Ask children if they have questions or concerns. If they ask
              questions, let those questions lead the conversation. If they do
              not have questions do not push. You have let them know it is ok to
              talk and they may come back to you later when they want to discuss
              the event.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-5">
            <h2 class="">Explain Event Simply</h2>
            <p>
              Explain the event as simply and directly as possible. For
              preschool children they may be content with just a simple
              explanation of what happened and how it will affect them. Older
              children will likely want and need additional information about
              the disaster and recovery efforts. If there are any tasks that you
              can suggest for them to do in the recovery it may be healing for
              them.

          <div id="tab-6">
            <h2 class="">Acknowledge Loss</h2>
            <p>
              Acknowledge the losses that children are dealing with. They may
              have to relocate, be separated from friends, or observe their
              parents struggling with financial hardships. Allow children to
              express their sadness over these “secondary losses.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-7">
            <h2 class="">Limit Media</h2>
            <p>
              Limit exposure to media coverage of the event. Graphic stories or
              images of the event on television, internet, radio, newspaper, and
              social media may frighten and stress children more. Avoid or limit
              children’s exposure to this.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-8">
            <h2 class="">Express Feelings</h2>
            <p>
              Let children express their feelings. Infants and toddlers may
              express their feelings by crying more, being fussy, and difficult
              to soothe. Toddlers may have temper tantrums and be clingy.
              Preschoolers and older children may need to talk about the event
              or draw pictures of it to express their feelings.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-9">
            <h2 class="">Restore Routine</h2>
            <p>
              As soon as you can, resume your regular routine. Do the activities
              you did before at the times you did them. Regular routines help
              children function better. If they do not feel up to certain
              activities yet do not force them. Find ways to have fun. This will
              also help children heal.
